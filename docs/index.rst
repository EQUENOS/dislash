=========================

Slash commands is a new Discord feature that allows to build user-friendly commands.
Once "**/**" is pressed on keyboard, the entire list of slash commands pops up.
The list includes hints and short description for each command, which makes exploring your bot much easier.

This Python library simplifies the process of building such commands.

It's recommended to read :ref:`quickstart` first.
